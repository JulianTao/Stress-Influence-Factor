# Stress-Influence-Factor

This notebook presents the common calculation methods for stress increment induced by a rectangular loading.

Defination of the problem:

Known: 

1) the loading is uniformly applied on an area measures B (width) x L (Length) at the ground surface

2) Point A is located below the center of the area at a depth of zf

3) Point B is located below the corner of the area at a depth of zf

Solve: 

1) the stress influence factor at A using a) Boussinesq method (Newark's solution); b) Poulos approximation method; c) 1:2 method

2) the stress influence factor at B using a) Boussinesq method (Newark's solution); b) 1:2 method

To Use the Code:

1) update the geometry parameters B, L and zf

2) hit run all cells and review the results
